=====

This project requires the assimp (model loading) and DevIL (image loading) libraries.

TODO:
* Update cmake to check for library dependencies
* Add code documentation
* Make sure everything is cleaned up correctly... add destructors
* add support for direct state access
* add support for uniform buffer objects
* add support for indirect rendering
* should probably move all model loading into its own file/class.
